1. Input and add two (mxn) matrices. Main thread creates m child threads. Thread 1 computes the first row. Thread 2 computes the second row. Thread m computes theh mth row elements of the result matrix.

2. Input two matrices A (m x n) and B (n x k). Find C = AB. Threads are used in the hierarchy shown.
