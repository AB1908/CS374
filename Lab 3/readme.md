# Lab 3

## Assigment

1. Write a program to create a full process tree of height _h_ and degree _n_. Be careful to avoid orphaning any processes.

2. Use the `exec()` family of system calls to call the previously created program (`tree.out`). Use four variants of the `exec()` call: `execlp()`, `execl()`, `execv()`, `execvp()`.
